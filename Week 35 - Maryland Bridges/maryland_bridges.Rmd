# dropping vehicles (duplicate), adding 2000 to the year so it is up to date, making categories for responsibility based on popular 4 then lumping rest, turns out there's Baltimore City and Baltimore city and fixing it,

How does the condition of bridges depend on when it was built?

```{r}

            total = n())

  ggplot(aes(decade, pct_good)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  expand_limits(y=0)
```
Most bridges built before 1970, we woud not consider in "good" condition (although it doesnt matter how long before 1970 they were built), while a  majority of bridges  built since 2000 are in Good condition.

```
No evidence of an effect of greography or ownership on bridge condition once we control for time.

```{r}
#multicolinearity
library(car)
vif(model4) # variance inflation factor, remove 1 at a time and re-run
```

Step 1: Calculate VIF of the model
Step 2: Identify if any variable has VIF greater than or equal to 5
Step 2a: Remove the variable from the model if it has a VIF greater than or equal to 5
Step 2b: If there are multiple variables with VIF greater than 5, only remove the variable with the highest VIF
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until VIF of all variables is less than 5
```{r}
# non-linear model given cubic spline tp better fit data
model4 <- bridges %>%
  mutate(good = bridge_condition == "Good") %>%
  glm(good ~ ns(yr_built, 4) + responsibility + county, data = ., family = "binomial")

# predictions
predictions<- augment(model4, bridges, type.predict = "response") %>%
  select(.fitted) %>%
  mutate(good = ifelse(.fitted > 0.5, TRUE, FALSE))

# results
conf_matrix <-table(predictions$good, bridges$good)
caret::confusionMatrix(conf_matrix)
```
Model has 82.5% accuracy
